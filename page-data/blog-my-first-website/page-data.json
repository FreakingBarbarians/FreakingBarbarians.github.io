I could have used square space or that wordpress thingy but I wanted to learn something a bit more low level. <br></br></p>\n<p>I followed this tutorial <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html\">https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html</a> and was able to make some sort of tic tac toe game in browser. Pretty neat. <br></br></p>\n<p>From there a friend of mine suggested that I try out Gatsby and that's what this current site is built off of. All I really wanted was a site where I could convert markdown into html kind of automagically and format it into a nice page. Gatsby lets me do all this with some extra work so I was pretty happy with that. <br></br></p>\n<p>Some useful links to accomplish this</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-remark/\">https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-remark/</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Transforms markdown into html</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/\">https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Lets gatsby see stuff in the filesystem. Important for finding the markdowns</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/graphql/\">https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/graphql/</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Some sort of querying language, I use it to query all the markdown source data</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using these three things I can automatically create web pages for each markdown <code>source</code> file and that gets turned into its own blog page. <br></br></p>\n<p>Glossing over some details that I don't fully understand... <br></br></p>\n<p>There seems to be some step in deployment that fills pages named like <code>{markdownRemark.frontmatter__slug}.tsx}</code> with the correct data from a graphql query inside. <br></br></p>\n<p>The blog page has some extra logic around it that lets me display summaries for the most recent blog posts. Its quite simple. I just made a react component with a div and a gradient (for the bottom fade) and it was just some CSS to hide the extra html. It was, for the most part, straightforward. CSS is terrible though. Very... unintuitive.<br></br></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference\">mozilla reference</a> helped me out alot. Very useful for seeing CSS in action. <br></br></p>\n<p>I'll probably have to tweak the translation process from markdown to html since it seems like line breaks aren't done well. At least double space or 2 whitespace doesn't work so I have to insert the <code>br</code> tags by hand which is painful.<br></br></p>\n<p>Otherwise its working very well :)<br></br></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 16, 2022","slug":"/blog-my-first-website","title":"Building a first website"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"61061274-f942-58a7-9e58-85caf4e8eb7a","frontmatter__slug":"/blog-my-first-website","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog-my-first-website"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
