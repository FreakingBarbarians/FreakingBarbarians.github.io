Basically all the usual suspects for deep midnight conversation.\r\nIt was during this time, and during my attempt at verbalizing my ideas on the subject<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>, that I realized I had a model that worked very very well for me. I don't really have existential dread, nor do I fear dying<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>. I don't have the words yet to describe it in detail but I did write a poem about it that I recited at an open mic in San Francisco recently.
