And I came home feeling like a thing incapable of being loved by anyone. All the light in my life seemed to have been chased out, cast under great shadow. And all beautiful things turned formless and dim.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWere there a pile of gems that glittered at my feet I would have passed them unnoticed.\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot see very far in the dark.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn my despair I wrote a poem. Which for me is a good way to cope. Thinking about things may put the thoughts out but not the feelings. You need to pour your feelings into something to understand them better. A friend taught me that.<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are diamonds and coals made of the same stuff<br>\r\nOne is smooth, and the other is rough<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Diamonds are loved and cherished by all<br>\r\nCoals are burned, their ashes let fall<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Coals wish to be diamonds, glittering lit<br>\r\nFor diamonds have homes in rings that they fit<br>\r\nAnd coals gather gravely in pits.<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Burning,<br>\r\nthick smoke in the air<br>\r\nIn furnaces, pizza parlors, and steam locomotion<br>\r\nLost and forgotten in daily commotion<br>\r\nAnd to the coal that wants love we say<br>\r\nHow could it dare<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the coal that is burned again and again<br>\r\nWhat mercy, what kindness can it then defend?<br>\r\nAgainst a world so unfair burned now to sinters,<br>\r\nWhere green glens gone, combusted to splinters<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And diamonds fly high,<br>\r\ninto the sky<br>\r\nShining in the air,<br>\r\nwith little to care<br>\r\ncoals they gather in pits of despair<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And I am a coal doomed there to stay.<br>\r\nAll of my life,<br>\r\nforever and a day<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>I reached out to a few friends then, and was met with an outpouring of love and support. And for that I am grateful. They reminded me of dim things in the distance that were once bright under day, and that the sun would rise again. And some others gave me\r\nadvice on exactly what to do with the pain I was experiencing.<br><br></p>\n<p>You need to feel it. And I believe that is the thing to do. And there is great wisdom in that. I believe that If you were to push away these feelings, ignore them, you train yourself to be tough and distant. For you either accept the pain or delude yourself with thoughts such as: why me, life is unfair, when will it be my turn, the world is backwards. Or you fill your mind with thoughts of ill woe towards those who caused the heartbreak. These thoughts are poisonous, and to pay heed to them would be to stray from the path of wisdom. And they would not heal you, though they would comfort you. It would be wrapping many bands of iron over the wound and then forgetting about it, and where once was warm and soft now is cold hard metal.<br><br></p>\n<p>\"Take the L\" as she said, you need at least one to spell love. And if you take many then you may write it many times over<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Others still spent the rest of the night with me, nursing me back to good spirits. And it is only with them that I began to really feel it. To let the pain in, in a safe place.<br><br></p>\n<p>And it was in the lasting warmth from all my friends that I wrote my second poem that day.<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Diamonds and coal are the same the end<br>\r\nAnd diamonds glow brightly<br>\r\nbecause they are held tightly<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And we often look at the tips of mountains,<br>\r\nignoring the valleys, admiring fountains<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And all things can be loved in this worldly garden<br>\r\nBe they gold or gems, or lumps of carbon<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But beware the hardening of the heart,<br>\r\nFor that is where all responses start<br>\r\nIn times that are rough,<br>\r\nbecoming distant and tough<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Love is hard, and that is why its valuable<br>\r\nThe heart must be soft, and like gold malleable<br>\r\nfor the souls of people come in many shapes<br>\r\nJagged and smooth, closed and agape<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if you are like iron<br>\r\nYou will be too hard to mould<br>\r\nAnd if you see a place high and beautiful<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And for the rest of your life you would like there to sit<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a good chance that you will not fit<br>\r\nMuch like lines that are supposed to rhyme<br>\r\nOr fall into rhythm, they step out of time<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And<br>\r\nEven in the right time,<br>\r\nWhen all the world is gleaming<br>\r\nthe angels on high, a choir singing<br>\r\nAnd all the suns light is beaming<br>\r\nYour heart will lay there,<br>\r\nin dark slumber<br>\r\ndreaming<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So awake and open your heart<br>\r\nDo not harden, do not start<br>\r\nAnd love will come from a hidden place<br>\r\never streaming<br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">I do not know where the other letters come from<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">â†©</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 15, 2023","slug":"/blog-heartbreak","title":"Thoughts on Heartbreak"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7a5c9266-399c-591d-972b-455acc8b3ad0","frontmatter__slug":"/blog-heartbreak","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog-heartbreak"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
