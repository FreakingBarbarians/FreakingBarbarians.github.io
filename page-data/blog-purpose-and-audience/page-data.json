But often these thoughts are born and die inside my mind and they aren't useful to anyone, myself included. Some of them, I think, could be quite good if I took the time to communicate them; and in that process they would crystallize into something more fully thought out. In order to produce something good you have to do so with the intention of showing others. Otherwise things don't get finished, everything becomes <code>virtual</code><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, and you never actually care about what the end product is.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd so I made this as a vehicle to crystalize and improve the quality of my thoughts.</p>\n<h4>I made this website for <em>someone</em>.</h4>\n<p>But that someone exists only in the abstract. As I envision the audience, the topics that I'm comfortable approaching and the manner in which I write change vastly. If I think about close friends or family, I get shy and probably won't write about things I'm afraid of sharing<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>. If I think about strangers, then I'll write only about serious things. If I think about people in my field, this will quickly turn into a technical blog. I think the best way is to think of no one in particular and write for myself. But if that's the case then why publish any of this, i'll be better off just letting it sit on my hard-drive<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd so I have settled with: Writing for myself, knowing that someone will read it<sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup>.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou will likely see, a blur of many things. But at the top of my mind are, poems, and stories, and musings on life. And maybe something technical every now and then. And a lot of rambling.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd so I made this to share the parts of my mind that I deem interesting</p>\n<h4>I made this website so that I could be brave.</h4>\n<p>I'm usually the kind of person that doesn't really share their opinion. Not unless I think its really good, and absolutely ready. But by then the ideas are overcooked, or the moment has passed. Or they've been fine tuned to be always correct in every circumstance to the point of saying nothing and being of use to no one.\r\n<br></br>\r\nAnd so I made this to be brave.</p>\n<h4>I have recently been inspired by a friend of mine to step out of my comfort zone more frequently.</h4>\n<p>And so putting my thoughts down and sharing them on my blargh is a way of doing that.</p>\n<p><br></br>\r\nWill I be brave enough to write about the things that I want to?\r\n<br></br>\r\nWill I be able to be open and honest with my audience?\r\n<br></br>\r\nWill the quality of my thought actually improve and can I keep this going?\r\n<br></br>\r\nI don't know. And I think that's okay. Half the fun in anything is not knowing, the other half is finding out<sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup>.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">I have 2 brain cells and one of them is on vacation<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">I consider thoughts, or anything that begins and ends in the mind virtual.
