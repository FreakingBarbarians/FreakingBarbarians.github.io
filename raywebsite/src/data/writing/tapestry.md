#### I was talking with some friends recently about mortality
and where we go when we die, and what life is. Basically all the usual suspects for deep midnight conversation.
It was during this time, and during my attempt at verbalizing my ideas on the subject[^1], that I realized I had a model that worked very very well for me. I don't really have existential dread, nor do I fear dying[^2]. I don't have the words yet to describe it in detail but I did write a poem about it that I recited at an open mic in San Francisco recently. It captures much of what I would try to say otherwise.

> I speak now of a tapestry unseen <br>
> Woven quite at random; Or so it would seem <br>
> With humble beginnings in the annals of time <br>
> It's image mysterious, obtuse, and sublime <br>
> <br>
> And each thread is woven guiding themselves <br>
> Ever on West to East do they delve <br>
> <br>
> Some threads are thick and vibrant and long<br>
> And some are weak and brittle,<br>
> And shine but little<br>
> <br>
> Some start small and end big and tall<br>
> Some start high, take hubris and fall<br>
> <br>
> Some colors are organized, patterned black or white<br>
> Others are mixed, intermingled for the eyes delight<br>
> <br>
> And some threads are rich with colour suffused<br>
> Others are old, faded, abused<br>
> <br>
> Some threads are wound, and go for a while<br>
> Here they are bound, in friendly style<br>
> Some they flock like birds, at every bend<br>
> Some others they part, their fellowships end<br>
> <br>
> And Where two threads meet,<br>
> their frayed ends greet<br>
> And make new colours<br>
> upon one another<br>
> And these threads should go<br>
> together to the end<br>
> Forming a band<br>
> A marvellous blend<br>
> <br>
> And so this tapestry it grows<br>
> it grows and it shrinks<br>
> And some threads are wise<br>
> And others don't think<br>
> <br>
> Causing such mighty tears<br>
> The tapestry must bear<br>
> And many threads cut short or lost<br>
> <br>
> But where one thread ends<br>
> another begins<br>
> So the cycle continues<br>
> Again and Again<br>
> <br>
> But does one thread know the image it makes<br>
> other threads feel the space that it takes<br>
> And all these threads, they cross and they mingle<br>
> And there are no threads that exist which are single<br>
> <br>
> Even the shortest of Strands<br>
> In the Tapestry has a hand<br>
> <br>
> And even the oldest and earliest of strings<br>
> Still go on<br>
> hidden, unseen<br>
> <br>
> And I do not fear the day that I die<br>
> For a thread on a tapestry, simply am I<br>

[^1]: The verbalization of the idea did not go so well. I basically opened my mouth, said a bunch of words that didn't really make sense, and closed it -- nodding in satisfaction. Like a toddler, who shits himself and is proud.

[^2]: note that I say so now being young and healthy. So these thoughts likely spring from the palm of ignorance
